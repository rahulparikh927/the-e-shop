## Overview

Your task is to build a high-performance e-commerce platform using Next.js. This assignment will evaluate your skills in advanced React and Next.js concepts, as well as your ability to implement complex frontend functionalities.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)

- Use SSR for dynamic pages requiring real-time data (e.g., a product collection page with simple live inventory).
- Optimize image loading using Next.js Image component.

### 2. Custom Shopping Cart with Real-Time Updates

Develop a cart system with the following features:

- Global state management (using Context API or a state management library like redux).
- Real-time updates reflecting inventory changes and price updates.

### 3. Advanced Search Functionality with Faceted Filtering

Create a powerful search system including:

- Server-side call to fetch the search results.
- Should show search suggestions while searching.
- Add Debouncing in search results

## Technical Considerations

- Use CSS library Tailwind css (minimal UI design required)
- Prioritize the Functionality implementation instead of UI design
- Make the interface fully responsive and mobile-optimized.
- You can use mongodb as database or make a dummy API to fetch all the data required or If not comfortable, do the task using a dummy JSON file as well.

## Deliverables

1. A GitHub repository with your code.
2. Sent invite to our developer - ShaileshKV29 and Rushijoshi3798
3. A deployed version of your application (e.g., on Vercel).
4. A short video (3-5 minutes) demonstrating the key features of your implementation.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and organization
- Performance optimization techniques
- Implementation of Next.js features (SSR, SSG, ISR)
- User experience and basic Interface design
- Handling of edge cases and error states
- Code comments & Coding standards

## Time Frame
